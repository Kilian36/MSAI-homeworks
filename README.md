# MSAI-homeworks
Solutions of the laboratory sessions of the course of Mathematical and Statistical methods for AI.
This repository contains some notebooks where some basic concepts about AI are explored. In particular, for each of them there's a PDF attached with the original questions, lokking at them could be useful for a better understaning.

All the implementations are actually from a low level perspertive, there're certanly more precise and general implementations in the web. 
The main topics explored are:
1. Floating point representation, Ill-conditioning and propagation of errors.
2. Classification of MNIST using PCA and LDA decomposition. Comparision between the results.
3. Implementation of gradient descent and stochastic gradient methods.
4. Regression of artificial data using statistical approaches, such as maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori.

Sadly this verison of the notebooks in not commented, but The comments file contain a detailed explaination of the contents.
